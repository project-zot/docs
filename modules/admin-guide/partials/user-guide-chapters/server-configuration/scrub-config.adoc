== Scrubbing the image registry

To check the integrity of the filesystem and the data in the registry, you can schedule
a periodic scrub operation. The scrub process traverses the filesystem, verifying
that all data blocks are readable. While running, the process may slightly reduce the
registry performance.

To enable scrubbing, add the `scrub` attribute under `extensions` in the
configuration file, as shown in the following example:

[source,json]
----
"extensions": {
  "scrub": {
    "enable": true,
    "interval": "24h"
  }
}
----

The following table lists the configurable attributes for scrubbing the registry.

[%autowidth]
|===
| Attribute | Description

| `enable` |
If this attribute is missing, registry scrubbing is enabled by default.
Scrubbing can be disabled by setting this attribute to `false`.
| `interval` |
The time interval between periodic scrub operations. This value must be at
least two hours (`2h`).
