== Clustering {zotLowerName}

To ensure high-availability of the registry,`zot` supports a clustering scheme with stateless `zot` instances/replicas fronted by a loadbalancer and a shared remote backend storage. This scheme allows the registry service to remain available even if a few replicas fail or become unavailable. Loadbalancing across many zot replicas can also increase aggregate network throughput.

For detailed information about clustering with `zot`, see xref:kb:clustering.adoc[zot Clustering].
