== Identity-based authorization

User identity can be used as an authorization criterion for allowing actions on one or more repository paths.  For specific users, you can choose to allow any combination of read, create, update, or delete actions on specific repository paths.

For detailed information about configuring access control policies for your `zot` registry, see xref:kb:authn-authz.adoc[User Authentication and Authorization with zot].
