== Basic authentication

Use the `auth` and `htpasswd` attributes under `http` in the configuration file
to enable and configure local authentication, as shown in the following example.

[source,json]
----
"http": {
  "auth": {
    "htpasswd": {
      "path": "test/data/htpasswd"
    }
  }
}
----

The `path` attribute specifies the path and filename of the `.htpasswd` file, which
contains user names and hashed passwords.

NOTE: When both htpasswd and LDAP configuration are specified, LDAP authentication
is given preference.
