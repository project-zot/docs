== Preventing automated attacks with failure delay

Use the `auth` and `failDelay` attributes under `http` in the configuration file
to delay the response to an authentication failure. A delayed response helps to
prevent automated attacks. The configuration is shown in the following example.

----
"http": {
  "auth": {
    "failDelay": 5
  }
}
----

The `failDelay` attribute specifies a waiting time, in seconds, before {zotLowerName}
sends a failure notification to an authenticating user who has been denied access.

.MIKE'S QUESTIONS
****
. What are the units, range, recommended value?
^ units "in seconds", and no recommended value (maybe 2-5 seconds). The main idea is that we don't
have internet robots/scripts continuously trying to guess a passwd in a tight
loop.
