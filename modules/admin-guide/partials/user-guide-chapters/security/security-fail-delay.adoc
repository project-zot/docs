== Preventing automated attacks with failure delay

Use the `auth` and `failDelay` attributes under `http` in the configuration file
to delay the response to an authentication failure. A delayed response helps to
prevent automated attacks. The configuration is shown in the following example.

[source,json]
----
"http": {
  "auth": {
    "failDelay": 5
  }
}
----

The `failDelay` attribute specifies a waiting time, in seconds, before {zotLowerName}
sends a failure notification to an authenticating user who has been denied access.
