== Benchmarking zot with zb

The https://github.com/project-zot/zot[zot project] includes the `zb` tool, which allows you to benchmark a `zot` registry or any other container image registry that conforms to the https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec[OCI Distribution Specification] published by the Open Container Initiative (OCI).

The `zb` tool is useful for benchmarking `zot` registry workloads in scenarios such as the following:

- comparing configuration changes
- comparing software versions
- comparing hardware/deployment environments
- comparing with other registries

For detailed information about benchmarking with `zb`, see xref:kb:benchmarking-with-zb.adoc[Benchmarking zot with zb].
