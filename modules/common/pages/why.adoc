= Why {zotLowerName}?
:zotUpperName: Zot
:zotLowerName: zot

At its heart, zot is a production-ready, vendor-neutral OCI image registry with
images stored in the OCI image format and with the OCI distribution specification on-the-wire.
{zotUpperName} is built for developers by developers, offering features such as
minimal deployment using a single binary image, built-in authentication and
authorization, and inline garbage collection and storage deduplication.

Some of the principal advantages of {zotLowerName} are:

- Open source
- OCI standards-only both on-the-wire and on-disk
- Clear separation between core distribution spec and zot-specific extensions
- Software supply chain security, including support for
http://github.com/sigstore/cosign[cosign] and
http://github.com/notaryproject[notation]
- Security hardening
- Single binary with many features built-in
- Suitable for deployments in cloud, bare-metal, and embedded devices

{zotUpperName} fully conforms to the
https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec[OCI Distribution Specification].

distribution-spec compliant registry in order to reduce library dependencies
and the possible attack surface.
