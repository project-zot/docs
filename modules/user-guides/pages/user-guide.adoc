====
The `zot` GUI provides a user-friendly web interface for browsing, searching, and downloading images from a `zot` registry. 
====

When you access the `zot` GUI with your browser, `zot` detects whether authentication is required.  If anonymous access is allowed, you enter the main page; otherwise, you may be asked to provide credentials.  The initial page displays tiles of the most popular image repositories along with a "news feed" of popular and recently updated repositories. 

Repositories are presented as "image tiles," which provide basic repository information such as repository name, image signature status, vulnerabilities status, tags, author, and number of downloads.

Click any of the displayed image tiles to view details, or search for an image or repository that is not displayed.

== Searching for an image

Enter an image name in the search box and click the search icon.

The search results are displayed along with a set of filters that can be applied to refine the search results. The filters include the following image attributes:

- Intended operating system of the image
- Intended hardware architecture of the image
- Whether the image is signed

NOTE: The filters appear only if you click the search icon instead of selecting an autosuggested name.

Applying filters if needed, click the image tile that you're searching for.


== Viewing image versions and details

When you select an image tile, the image repository's **OVERVIEW**  page opens.

This page and its subpages display the source repository, the number of downloads, the last publish date, the image size, and a link to the licensing information.

On the **OVERVIEW** page, click **TAGS** to view the available versions of the image.

=== Viewing a specific image version

Click a specific tag to see details of that image version.

The page for a specific image version opens with the image **LAYERS** tab, showing components of the image file.

Using podman with no additional command options:

[source,shell]
----
$ podman pull example.com:5000/python:bullseye
