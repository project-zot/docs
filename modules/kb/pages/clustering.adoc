====
High availability of the `zot` registry is supported by the following features:

* Stateless `zot` instances to simplify scale out

* Bare-metal and Kubernetes deployments
====


To ensure high-availability of the registry,`zot` supports a clustering scheme with stateless `zot` instances/replicas fronted by a loadbalancer and a shared remote backend storage. This scheme allows the registry service to remain available even if a few replicas fail or become unavailable. Loadbalancing across many zot replicas can also increase aggregate network throughput.

Clustering is supported in both bare-metal and Kubernetes environments.

NOTE: The remote backend storage must be https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html[S3 API-compatible].


== Bare-metal deployment

=== Prerequisites

* A highly-available loadbalancer such as `HAProxy` configured to direct traffic to `zot` replicas.

* Multiple `zot` replicas as `systemd` services hosted on mutiple hosts or VMs.

* AWS S3 API-compatible remote backend storage.

== Kubernetes deployment

=== Prerequisites

* A `zot` Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/[Deployment] with required number of replicas.

* AWS S3 API-compatible remote backend storage.

* A `zot` Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/[Service].

* A `zot` Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/[Ingress Gateway] if the service needs to be exposed outside.

== Implementing stateless zot

`zot` maintains two types of durable state:

* the actual image data itself
* the image metadata in the registry's cache

In a stateless clustering scheme, the image data is stored in the remote storage backend and the registry cache is disabled by turning off both deduplication and garbage collection.

== Ecosystem tools

The https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec[OCI Distribution Specification] imposes certain rules about the HTTP URI paths to which various ecosystem tools must conform.  Consider these rules when setting the HTTP prefixes during loadbalancing and ingress gateway configuration.
