====
An **OCI-native** secure container image build/delivery pipeline using the following tools:

- https://github.com/project-stacker/stacker[`stacker`]
for building OCI images

- https://github.com/project-zot/zot[`zot`]
as a vendor-neutral OCI image registry server

- https://github.com/containers/skopeo[`skopeo`]
for performing repository interactions

- https://github.com/sigstore/cosign[`cosign`]
for container signing and verification

- https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o[`cri-o`]
for deploying container images

- https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/sigstore/cosigned#deploy-cosigned-helm-chart[`cosigned`]
for validating container images before deployment

The https://opencontainers.org/[Open Container Initiative (OCI)]footnote:[https://opencontainers.org/] is an open governance structure for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtimes.

This document describes a step-by-step procedure towards achieving an OCI-native secure software supply chain using https://github.com/project-zot/zot[`zot`]footnote:fn-zot[https://github.com/project-zot/zot] in collaboration with other opensource tools. The following diagram shows a portion of the CI/CD pipeline.

== Build images

https://github.com/project-stacker/stacker[`stacker`]footnote:[https://github.com/project-stacker/stacker] is a standalone tool for building OCI images via a declarative `yaml` format. The output of the build process is a container image in an OCI layout.

.example: stacker build command
```
stacker build -f <stackerfile.yaml>
```

== Image registry

https://github.com/project-zot/zot[`zot`]footnote:fn-zot[] is a production-ready vendor-neutral OCI image registry server purely based on the https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec[OCI Distribution Specification]footnote:[https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec]. If `stacker` is used to build the OCI image, it can also be used to publish the built image to an OCI registry.

.example: stacker publish command
```
stacker publish --url <url> --username <user> --password <password>
```

Alternatively, you can use https://github.com/containers/skopeo[`skopeo`]footnote:[https://github.com/containers/skopeo], a command line utility that performs various operations on container images and image repositories.

.example: skopeo copies an image to a registry
```
skopeo copy --format=oci oci:<oci-dir>/image:tag \
  docker://<zot-server>/image:tag
```

== Signing images

https://github.com/sigstore/cosign[`cosign`]footnote:[https://github.com/sigstore/cosign] is a tool that performs container signing, verification, and storage in an OCI registry.

.example: cosign generates keys and signs an image in the registry
```
cosign generate-key-pair

cosign sign --key cosign.key <zot-server>/image:tag
```

== Deploying container images

https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o[`cri-o`]footnote:[https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o] is an implementation of the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri/[Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI)]footnote:[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri/] to enable using OCI compatible runtimes. It is a lightweight alternative to using Docker as the runtime for Kubernetes.

.example: kubelet configuration file
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: <zot-server>/image:tag
```

== Container image verification

https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/sigstore/cosigned#deploy-cosigned-helm-chart[`cosigned`]footnote:[https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/sigstore/cosigned#deploy-cosigned-helm-chart] is an image admission controller that validates container images before deploying them.

.example: install cosigned using Helm
```
kubectl create namespace cosign-system

kubectl create secret generic mysecret -n \
  cosign-system --from-file=cosign.pub=./cosign.pub

helm repo add sigstore https://sigstore.github.io/helm-charts

helm repo update

helm install cosigned -n cosign-system sigstore/cosigned \
  --devel --set cosign.secretKeyRef.name=mysecret
```
