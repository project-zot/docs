== What is {zotLowerName}?

{zotUpperName} is an open-source, vendor-neutral container image registry application based purely
on the https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec[OCI Distribution Specification]
published by the Open Container Initiative (OCI).

An OCI image registry is a server-based application that allows you to store, manage, and share
container images.  A developer uploads (pushes) an image to the registry for distribution. Users can
then download (pull) the image to run on their systems.  The OCI Distribution Specification
defines a standard API protocol for these and other image registry operations.

An image registry can be a part of your continuous integration and continuous
deployment (CI/CD) pipeline when you host {zotLowerName} on your public or
private server. In its minimal form, you can also embed a {zotLowerName} registry
in a product.  In either case, {zotLowerName} provides a secure
software supply chain for container images.
