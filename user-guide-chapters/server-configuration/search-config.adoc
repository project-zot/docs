== Searching and querying images

While basic searching is always enabled for images in the {zotLowerName} registry,
you can enable enhanced registry searching and filtering using graphQL.

Add the `search` attribute under `extensions` in the configuration file to enable
and configure the enhanced search extension, as shown in the following example.

----
"extensions": {
    "search": {
        "enable": true,
        "cve": {
            "updateInterval": "2h"
        }
    }
}
----

The following table lists the configurable attributes for enhanced search.

search can be disabled by setting this attribute to `false`.
| `cve` | Extends enhanced search to allow searching of Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVE).
| `updateInterval` | Sets the interval at which the searchable database of CVE items
is refreshed.
